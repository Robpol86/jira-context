# jira-context

Do you have command line applications which interact with JIRA servers? Do your users have to enter their credentials
every time they run your applications? Are you unable to use OAuth because your command line application is open sourced
or you have no way of securing the consumer secret?

Hi, Robpol86 here for jira-context. The easy way to prompt for credentials and cache session cookies on your clients'
workstations.

* Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 supported on Linux and OS X.

from __future__ import print_function
import sys
from jira_context import JIRA

server = 'https://jira.company.local'
query = 'assignee = currentUser() AND resolution = Unresolved'
if len(sys.argv) == 2:
    JIRA.FORCE_USER = sys.argv[1]

print('Connecting to: ' + server)
with JIRA(server=server) as j:
    if j.ABORTED_BY_USER:
        print('Aborted by user.', file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    issues = j.search_issues(query, maxResults=5)

for issue in issues:
    print(issue.key, issue.fields.summary)
```

## Class Attributes

### Persisted

These attributes/variables are persisted throughout the lifetime of the currently running process. If you've got two
`with` blocks and `ABORTED_BY_USER` becomes True in the first one, the second block will skip authentication.

Name | Description/Notes
:--- | :----------------
`ABORTED_BY_USER` | False by default. Becomes True if `USER_CAN_ABORT` is True and the user enters a blank username or password.
`COOKIE_CACHE_FILE_PATH` | File path to the cache file used to store the base64 encoded session cookie.
`FORCE_USER` | If set to a string, user won't be prompted for their username.
`USER_CAN_ABORT` | Set to False if you don't want the user to continue without a JIRA session if they enter a blank user/pass.

### Instance

These attributes are persisted only in the current JIRA() instance.

Name | Description/Notes
:--- | :----------------
`prompt_for_credentials` | Instantiate with False if you don't want the user prompted for credentials (useful in threads).
`authentication_failed` | Becomes True if `prompt_for_credentials` is False and cached cookies were invalid/missing.
