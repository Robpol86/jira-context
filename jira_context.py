"""Cache JIRA basic authentication sessions to disk for console apps.

Designed for command line programs/scripts as a context manager. When used, the JIRA class attempts to resume a
previously saved session stored on disk (by default in the user's home directory). If the session has expired or fails,
the user will be prompted for their credentials, and upon authentication the session cookie is cached to disk. The main
goal of this library is to avoid having the user repeatedly enter their JIRA credentials every time they use a console
application, either within the same process or when they re-run an application which uses this library.

    Authentication happens not during instantiation but when the context is entered (using the `with` statement). Cookie
    caching only happens on context exit (after the `with` code block) if authentication was successful and a new cookie
    was returned by the JIRA server.

    Class variables (persists until the application terminates):
    ABORTED_BY_USER -- False by default. Set to True if USER_CAN_ABORT is True and the user enters a blank username or
        password. If this variable is ever set to True, this class will never authenticate (both cookie or password
        methods).
    COOKIE_CACHE_FILE_PATH -- file path to the cache file used to store the base64 encoded session cookie.
    FORCE_USER -- if set to a string, user won't be prompted for their username. Value of this variable will be used
        instead.
    USER_CAN_ABORT -- by default if a user enters a blank username or password, it is understood that they do not want
        to authenticate to the JIRA server. Set this to False to send blank user/passwords to the JIRA server which will
        inevitably result in an authentication error, causing the program to prompt the user for their credentials
        again.

    Instance variables:
    prompt_for_credentials -- by default user will be prompted for credentials if cached cookies fail. If False the user
        won't be prompted for credentials. If cached cookies are valid then the program may be able to authenticate if
        they are not invalid. If cached cookies are not available or are invalid/expired and this is True, user will not
        be authenticated and `authentication_failed` will be set to True. This variable is useful to set during
        instantiation when used within a thread.
    authentication_failed -- will be set to True if authentication was not successful and user is not prompted for
        credentials.
